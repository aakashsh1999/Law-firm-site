                    <p>Dreams and plans are frequently derailed when crashes occur. Fortunately, victims of crashes can
                        access compensation to address their losses. However, the compensation process is notoriously

                        qualified NYC car accident lawyer to fight against insurance adjusters to get a compensation

                    <h2>Where in New York Do Most Car Accidents Happen?</h2>
                    <p>Car accidents occur throughout the five boroughs. However, Queens and Brooklyn tend to see the
                        most crashes. That said, each borough has its hot spots where motor vehicle accidents occur at a
                        higher rate than in other locations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Some of the NYC hot spots for crashes include:</strong></p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li>42nd Street and 8th Ave in Manhattan</li>
                        <li>East 14th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan</li>
                        <li>Tillary Street and Jay Street in Brooklyn</li>
                        <li>Flatbush and Tillary Street in Brooklyn</li>
                        <li>Roosevelt Ave and 58th Street in Queens</li>

                        <li>Grand Concourse in the Bronx</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Having the knowledge of where car accidents frequently occur can help keep you safe as you

                    <h2>We Handle Every Type of Car Accident in New York</h2>
                    <p>Our attorneys have represented injury victims from the Bronx to Staten Island in all kinds of
                        accidents. Below are some of the more common types of accidents in the city.</p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li><strong>Head-On Collisions:</strong> The forces from a head-on collision are typically much
                            more powerful than those in other accidents. They routinely cause serious personal injuries,
                            from traumatic brain injuries to burns from explosions and post-accident fires.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rollover Accidents:</strong> Rollover accidents put a car's occupants at serious
                            risk of injury or death due to the roof of the car collapsing. Additionally, rollovers can
                            result in passengers being ejected from the vehicle if a seat belt fails or is not used.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Sideswipe Collisions: </strong>Sideswipe collisions are a direct result of careless
                            actions, such as failure to yield. Passengers on the impact side of the vehicle face a
                            significant risk of catastrophic injuries or death.</li>

                    <h2>What Should You Do After a Car Accident in New York?</h2>
                    <p>If you're ever involved in a car accident, it's important to know that what you do immediately
                        after the crash can affect your life forever. Although your first instinct may be to panic, it
                        is essential to keep calm and follow a few steps that will help keep you safe and preserve your
                        claim for compensation.</p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li><strong>Remain at the Scene:</strong> Do not leave the scene of an accident. Doing so puts
                            your claim for compensation in jeopardy. It is also a crime punishable by up to one year in
                            jail and hundreds of dollars in fines and court costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Get to a Safe Place:</strong> If possible, move your vehicle to a place of safety so
                            you don't cause a subsequent crash. If you cannot move your vehicle, do not remain inside it
                            or near it if it is on the road.</li>
                        <li><strong>Call the Police:</strong> Call the police so you have an official police report of
                            the accident, which you will need when filing a claim for compensation. Although you have up
                            to 10 days to report accidents causing injuries, calling the police to the scene is a wise
                            choice for injury victims seeking compensation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Get Medical Treatment: </strong>Seek medical treatment as soon as possible after you
                            have been injured. Failure to do so can lead to the insurance company questioning the cause
                            and seriousness of your injuries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Do Not Say Sorry or Admit Fault: </strong>What you say after an accident can be used
                            against you. Therefore, it is important to refrain from admitting guilt or responsibility
                            for the crash.</li>
                        <li><strong>Refuse Early Settlement Offers: </strong>Car insurance companies like to tempt NYC
                            car accident victims with quick settlement offers that are less than what victims deserve.
                            If you receive an offer early on, do not accept it until you have spoken with an attorney
                            who can give you a realistic evaluation of how much your case is worth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Meet with an Attorney:</strong> To increase your odds of getting maximum
                            compensation for your injuries, you must find a dedicated car accident lawyer to represent
                            you. Victims with representation routinely receive far more compensation than those without
                            attorneys.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After facing a car accident, do not hesitate to meet with a reputable attorney. Doing so will
                        maximize your chances of getting the compensation you deserve.</p>

                    <h2>What Are the Most Common Causes of Car Accidents in New York?</h2>
                    <p>New York City has thousands of car accidents each week, and most of them have the same handful of
                        causes. The common factor in most of these causes is a failure to maintain proper safety
                        standards.</p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li><strong>Distracted Driving:</strong> Texting, rubbernecking, and reaching for items are a
                            few examples of distracted driving that lead to car accidents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Failure to Yield:</strong> Failure to yield when turning or entering roadways causes
                            serious accidents, such as T-bone collisions and accidents with pedestrians.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speeding:</strong> Speeding causes accidents because it reduces the time a driver
                            has to react to a dangerous situation. Additionally, speeding exacerbates the damage done in
                            car accidents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Driving Under the Influence:</strong> Although the tragic consequences of DUI are
                            clear, many drivers in New York City continue to drive while under the influence of drugs
                            and/or alcohol.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improper Passing:</strong> Drivers who execute passes improperly are typically in a
                            hurry and disregard the rules of the road. The results are head-on collisions and other
                            serious types of crashes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aggressive Driving:</strong> New York City has its fair share of aggressive drivers
                            who disregard the rules of the road to get where they're going. Unfortunately, their
                            aggression is a major cause of car accidents in the city.</li>
                        <li><strong>Defective Vehicles:</strong> Some car accidents in New York, NY, occur because of a
                            defect in a vehicle. Faulty tires, brakes, or other important vehicle parts can result in
                            serious accidents, even when the driver exercises reasonable care. In cases such as these,
                            the manufacturer or designer of the faulty part can be held to pay.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hazardous Road Conditions:</strong> All manner of hazardous road conditions can lead
                            to car accidents in the city. In many instances, the weather is to blame for these hazardous
                            conditions. In such cases, drivers must only drive as fast as the conditions allow. Other
                            times, potholes and poorly maintained roads are responsible for hazardous road conditions.
                        </li>

                    <h2>What Kind of Damages Are You Entitled to If You Have Gotten into a Car Accident in New York
                        City?</h2>
                    <p>If you have suffered injuries in a car accident, you are entitled to seek damages for your
                        losses. The type and extent of damages you receive depend on your situation. In many cases, the
                        limited damages of PIP insurance are the source of a car accident victim's compensation.
                        However, those who suffer serious injuries may seek full damages.</p>
                    <h3>Economic Damages</h3>
                    <p>Economic damages provide compensation for verifiable financial losses directly related to your
                        injury, including:</p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li>Medical bills and expenses</li>
                        <li>Lost wages and lost future earning capacity</li>
                        <li>Property damage</li>
                        <li>Expenses related to the hiring of home care workers to help around the house</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To prove economic damages, you only need receipts or account balances that verify your
                        expenditures.</p>
                    <h3>Non-Economic Damages</h3>
                    <p>Non-economic damages are more difficult to calculate because they have no inherent price tag.
                        That said, a car accident attorney will make sure that their clients receive the non-economic
                        damages they are entitled to, such as:</p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li>Pain and suffering</li>
                        <li>Emotional distress</li>
                        <li>Disfigurement and scarring</li>
                        <li>Loss of enjoyment of life</li>
                        <li>Loss of consortium</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Keep in mind that if your injuries are not considered to be serious, you will not be allowed to
                        recover compensation for non-economic damages. Instead, you will be limited to partial economic
                        damages offered under your PIP policy.</p>
                    <h3>Punitive Damages</h3>
                    <p>In some cases, the law allows accident victims to seek punitive damages. To qualify for punitive
                        damages, the victim must prove that the liable driver acted in a way that showed a clear and
                        conscious disregard for the safety of others. Drunk driving, for example, is a qualifying
                        behavior for punitive damages.</p>
