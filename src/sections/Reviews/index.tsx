                                              was going to need legal assistance because I was shocked that I was
                                              actually injured I called my fiancé and told her that I was going to
                                              need a lawyer, so she googled the top 5 &nbsp;personal injury law firms
                                              in NY and The Jacob Fuchsberg Law Firm came up. One of the
                                              representatives from the firm took the time to come personally to my
                                              home to see me, that immediately showed me that I was going to be able
                                              to make it through my pain and suffering they understood what I was
                                              going through and with patience, persistence, and diligence they were
                                              able to get the best results possible in settling my case. I highly
                                              recommend the Jacob Fuchsberg Law firm when the unexpected happens you
                                              will not be dissatisfied with the kind, courteous and professionalism
                                              that you would expect from a law firm.</p>
